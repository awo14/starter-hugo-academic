Greater levels of educational attainment (EA) have been associated with many positive life outcomes throughout adulthood. Prior work has focused upon the role of academic achievement in predicting EA; however, more recent work suggests EA is likely influenced by additional variables, including genetics. The current study used data collected in a longitudinal twin study to examine the direct impact of genes on individual differences in EA and the mediating role of other behaviors shown to impact EA. Results indicated that the polygenic score (PGS) for EA did not account for a significant amount of variance in EA, likely due to limitations in statistical power. However, the EA PGS did account for significant variation in math and reading achievement, as well as educational self-concept. The PGS also predicted financial responsibility in emerging adulthood. Altogether, findings support characteristics of adulthood defined by the developmental theory of emerging adulthood.
